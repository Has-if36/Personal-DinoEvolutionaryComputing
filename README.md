## A Personal Project
After getting lectures from Evolutionary Computing Subject. I would like to create a new project that uses Evolutionary Computing Algorithm. This project has been done quite some time, I might forget few things from the lecture.

## Evolutionary Computing Algorithm
### Population
Depends on the power of the computer, for my computer, I set at 200 of population, meaning there will 200 Dinos running in each run.

### Chromosome
Chromosome is the 'genetic' information or a group of gene for the AI to evolve, so it can improve. In this case, there are 19 informations or gene which are:

Gene | Desc
---|---
Jump Rock | aa
Duck Rock | aa
Idle Rock | aa
Jump Plant | aa
Duck Plant | aa
Idle Plant | aa
Jump birdLo | aa
Duck birdLo | aa
Idle birdLo | aa
Jump birdMid | aa
Duck birdMid | aa
Idle birdMid | aa
Jump birdHi | aa

Duck Duration | aa
Duck Duration SD | aa
Distance Obstacle | aa
